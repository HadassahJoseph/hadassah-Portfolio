        <p class="about">
          I am currently a Second year Computer Science major at Technological
          University Dublin. Since the beginning of my Finale year of secondary
          school I have been in intrigued by the world of computer science and
          it's endless possibilities and since the beginning of university that
          curiosity turned into a passion.So during the summer of 2022 I
          enrolled and completed various courses such as code first girls
          University kick-starter's, Harvard's CS50 etc.These platforms gave me
          the skill's to build websites and application I never thought I could
          create. I have acquired many skills to which i hope to benefit many
          companies with.
